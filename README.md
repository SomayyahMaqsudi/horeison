## Readme for "Accessibility Standards for Webpages":
This document outlines a set of accessibility standards for webpages that can help ensure that they are easy to navigate and understand for all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

## User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria:
Semantic HTML elements: When viewing the source code of the webpage, you should find that semantic HTML elements are used. These are HTML elements that convey the meaning of the content they contain, such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, and <section>.

Logical structure: The HTML elements should follow a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning. This means that the structure of the HTML elements should make sense even if all the styling and positioning were removed.

Accessible alt attributes: When viewing image elements, accessible alt attributes should be present. These attributes provide a description of the image that can be read by screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Sequential heading attributes: The heading attributes, such as <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc., should fall in sequential order. This helps users understand the hierarchy and structure of the content on the webpage.

Descriptive title element: When viewing the title element, you should find a concise, descriptive title that accurately reflects the content of the webpage. This helps users understand what the page is about and why they should visit it.

By following these accessibility standards, webpages can become more inclusive and accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
